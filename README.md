# WeShare - let's share üçª
üí° According to statistical data from the Ministry of the Interior, Executive Yuan, it is currently observed that **over 50% of households in Taiwan consist of two individuals or fewer**. 

#### In summer 2023, my team and I have completed a group-buying platform where anyone can become the initiator of a group purchase and, of course, also participate as a buyer. We have integrated Google Maps to enhance the search user experience. Here are some key features:

* We set up the environment using **Docker**, ensuring it's not bound by specific computer operating systems.
* We used **Redis' Rate Limiter** to implemented IP traffic control.
* Through **GitHub Actions**, I practiced **CI/CD**, accelerating the software development lifecycle while ensuring code quality.

## üöÄ How to reproduce the project?
**Recommended to run on AWS (EC2)**
1. Download WeShare from https://github.com/ycccccccccccc/WeShare
2. Navigate to the backend directory using the command cd backend
3. Configure the `.env` parameters: `DB_password` for MySQL password.
4. Create a folder named `private`, then add SSL key files named `certificate.crt` and `private.key`.
5. Run `docker-compose up --build`.
6. Congratulations! You can test it using Postman at `https://<ssl-url>/<API>`. For example, `https://13.238.130.147/users/signup`. This is the URL format.
